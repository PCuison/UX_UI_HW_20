            <h1>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h1>
            <h2>Onederlust is a conceptual mobile app that aims to transform the travel experience by empowering solo travelers already at their destinations to make the most of their adventures by getting opportunities to connect with the local community.</h2>
             <h4>The Problem:</h4>
               <p>Solo travelers face challenges in accessing reliable recommendations, authentic experiences, and a sense of community, which impacts their overall travel experience and hampers their ability to fully embrace the benefits of solo travel.</p>

               <h4>My Role:</h4>
               <p>Research, Wireframing, Prototyping, Visual Design</p>

               <h4>The Team:</h4>
               <p>Pamela Cuison (UX Designer)
                <br>Karen McRorie (UX Researcher)
               </p>

         <div class="text">
          <h1>Concept Background</h1>
             <p>Being a travel enthusiast, I couldn't help but notice an increasing trend in the number of people travelling after restrictions started easing. What was even more interesting was that more and more people and acquaintances I knew around me were choosing to travel solo. </p>

             <p>This got me thinking, &ldquo;How can I make their journeys even better?&rdquo; As I listened and spoke with these travelbugs, it became clear that they needed a dedicated app to support their solo adventures.  </p>

             <p>So, armed with this newfound knowledge and a burning passion to make solo travel awesome, I teamed up with Karen Rorie (UX Researcher), who had an interest to do the same, and together, we set out to create the ultimate solo travel app.

            <h1>FINAL THOUGHTS AND CONCLUSION</h1>
            <p>The ONEderlust Travel app is designed to cater to the unique needs of the solo travelers. It has the potential to revolutionize the way solo travelers plan and experience their trips. In our 4 weeks timeline, we were able to provide a hi-fidelity prototype of our travel app.</p
<p>As with any UX design project, there is always opportunity for further improvements and iterations. Next steps for improvement include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li> a translation feature</li>
            <li>a ‘what to expect’ guide of dos and don’ts</li>
            <li>a navigation feature</li>
            <li>for safety - a location tracker</li>
            <li>a share itinerary feature</li>
